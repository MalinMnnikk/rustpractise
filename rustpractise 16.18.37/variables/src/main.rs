// Variables
// immutable variables mean you cannot assign a variable multiple values to the same variable
// add 'mut' and the value is now mutable and can be assigned multiple times 
// mutation can be faster than copying and returning newly allocated instances

// constants = values that are bound to a name, immutable, cannot use 'mut', must be annotated
// useful for parts that all of the code need to know about
// const can only be set to a constant expression, not the result of a function callor other values that can only be computed at runtime 
// named with all uppercase and _ between words

// complietime error if the 'let' is not used! the value stays immutable even after we are done with it.

let spaces = "    ";
let spaces = spaces.len();

// mut cannot be used because we are not allowed to mutate a variables TYPE
// hence let mut spaces = "   "; spaces = spaces.len(); will cause a compiletime error 

// Data types = what kind of data is being specified so Rust knows how to work with it
// statically typed language, must know the types of all variables at compile time
// when many types are possible, use type annotation 
// if not the compiler will show an error requesting more information

// Scalar types>
// = represents a sing;e value, int, float, bool and char

// Integer types
// = number without a fractional component 
// signed = can be negative since it has the sign - infront of it 
// unsigned = only positive 
// isize or usize = when indexing a collection
// assigned integers out of range causes integer overflow
// compiling in release mode causes a overflow to 'wrap' --> in a u8 system a number 256 would become 0 and 257 1 and so on
